Dev environment
================================
This is a template project, where you can test out your component libraries and business objects. This template allows you to create a project with the same structure, as Trood Core Builder uses for bundling your external components and models.

You should also use this template for creating and bundling your own app manually, without using Trood Core Builder, while it is in pre-alpha and doesn't support many features, such as: adding new npm modules to your project, configuring libraries paths, auto-build etc.
